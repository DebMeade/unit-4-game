This game is called the Crystal Collector.  The purpose of this game is to have the user click on the different crystals in an attempt to match the target number.  Each time the user matches the target number they win and if they go over the target number they use.  Whenever the user wins or loses the game automatically restarts.

The target number is a random number that gets generated every time the game starts which includes when the initial screen is loaded.  The crystals also have random numbers generated every time the game loads as well as when the initial screen loads.
